    <h2>Aguie's Favorite Toys</h2>
    <p>Augie has a lot of favorte toys, but his favorite by far is Kong brand
       elk whole elk antlers! He'll chew on one of those for weeks until it looks
       like a stubby little cigar sticking from his mouth.
       <br/>
       Beyond antlers, however, he also enjoys his Kong bone and his indoor ball. </p>
