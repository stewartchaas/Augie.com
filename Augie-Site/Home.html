          <p class='who-is-augie'> Augie is a wonderful dog that my girlfriend and I adopted
                                   from the ASCPA in February of 2020. While we were
                                   innitially looking for a retriever, Augie's cute face and
                                   willingness to be loved drew us in. The first day we met
                                   him, we walked around Petco for 2 full hours just to spend
                                   time with him. After that walk (and a short nap on his part
                                   at our feet in the middle of the store) we knew he was the
                                   dog for us!
