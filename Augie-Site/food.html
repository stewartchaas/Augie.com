    <h2>What Food Does Augie Like?</h2>
    <p> When we first adopted Augie, he was eating Whole Hearted Chicken and Rice
        recipe from Petco. Nowadays we have him on the Salmon and Peas recipe
        because Salmon is a heart-healthy way to keep his coat healthy and his
        joints happy. This is important to us because we've heard tell of
        dogs of Augie's breeds can sometimes have issues with their joints later
        in life.
      <br/>
        We know this brand isn't the best posible brand though, so we're looking for alternatives!
